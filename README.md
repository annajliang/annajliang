My journey into web development and design all began on a website I frequented as a child called Neopets which inspired me to learn HTML and CSS at a young age.

Now as an adult, I've rekindled my love for coding and have gone on to expand upon my previous skill set and knowledge, but one thing that remains the same is my desire to creatively solve problems through code and to help make the web a pleasing and user-friendly experience for all.
