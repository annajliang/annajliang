## Hi there, I'm Anna! 👋

My journey into web development and design dates back to my childhood on a site called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopets" target=”_blank”/>Neopets</a>. It sparked my curiosity and motivated me to delve into learning HTML and CSS at a young age.

Today, as an adult, I have reconnected with my love for coding and have significantly broadened my skills and knowledge. However, one thing that has remained unchanged is my deep desire to use code as a creative problem-solving tool and to contribute to creating a delightful and user-friendly web experience for everyone.
